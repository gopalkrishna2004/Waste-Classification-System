# Waste Classification System

This repository contains a Waste Classification System developed using the RealWaste dataset. The system employs deep learning techniques to classify real-world waste into predefined categories, supporting improved waste management and recycling efforts.

## Features
- **RealWaste Dataset**: Trained on a publicly available dataset featuring real-world waste images.
- **Deep Learning Model**: Uses a VGG16-based Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for accurate classification.
- **End-to-End Pipeline**: Includes preprocessing, training, evaluation, and prediction workflows.
- **Visualization Tools**: Supports result analysis with confusion matrices and accuracy plots.

## Dataset
The system uses the [RealWaste dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/908/realwaste), which includes images of waste items categorized into multiple classes. The dataset is split into training, validation, and test sets to ensure robust model performance.
