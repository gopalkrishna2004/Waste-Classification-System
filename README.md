## Features
- **Accurate Waste Classification**: Classifies waste into categories using the RealWaste dataset.
- **Customizable**: Easily extendable for additional waste categories.
- **Optimized**: Uses advanced deep learning techniques for high accuracy.

## Dataset
The model is trained on the [RealWaste dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/908/realwaste), a publicly available dataset containing images of real-world waste items categorized into multiple classes.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/waste-classification-system.git
   cd waste-classification-system
   ```

2. Set up a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Download and prepare the RealWaste dataset by following the instructions in the `dataset/README.md` file.

## Usage

1. Train the model:
   ```bash
   python train.py --dataset_path <path_to_realwaste_dataset>
   ```

2. Evaluate the model:
   ```bash
   python evaluate.py --model_path <path_to_trained_model>
   ```

3. Use the model for prediction:
   ```bash
   python predict.py --image_path <path_to_image>
   ```

## Model Architecture
The system uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture, fine-tuned for the RealWaste dataset. The key components include:
- **Preprocessing**: Data augmentation and normalization.
- **Base Model**: A pretrained backbone (e.g., VGG16 or ResNet) with additional custom layers for classification.
- **Training**: Optimized with techniques such as learning rate scheduling and early stopping.

## Results
The model achieves:
- **Accuracy**: XX%
- **Precision**: XX%
- **Recall**: XX%

(Replace `XX%` with your actual results. Include a confusion matrix, sample predictions, or other visualizations if possible.)
